See which implementation is the most performant.

This project started off as an implementation of the "Coin Flip Streaks" experiment from [automate the boring stuff](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/chapter4/), ended up in an experiment which checks which implementation is the most performant. Thanks to [@bef1re](https://github.com/bef1re) for creating this together with me :-).
